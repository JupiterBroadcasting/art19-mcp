Defaults, examples, and\npossible values are additionally rendered in double quotes for readability. In practice, query parameters should\nnot have quotes around the values (e.g., `foo=bar` is valid, not `foo=\"bar\"`), and both query parameter keys\nand values must be percent-encoded, per the requirements in [RFC 3986 § 3.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.4).\n\n## Rate Limiting\n\nIn order to provide a fair distribution of available resources, all API calls are subject to rate limits.\nIf you exceed the number of API calls per minute granted to your credential, a `429 Too Many Requests`\nerror response will be returned.\n\nIn that case, a `Retry-After` header MAY be included in the response, describing the number of seconds\nafter which a request can be retried.\n\nIf you run into a high number of 429 errors, please reach out to ART19 Support to adjust your rate limit.\n\n### Example\n\nIn the following example the request can be retried after waiting for 21 seconds:\n\n    HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests\n    Content-Type: text/html\n    Retry-After: 21\n\n## Pagination\n\nRequests to collection endpoints **SHOULD** provide pagination parameters.\nSome endpoints **REQUIRE** pagination parameters to be provided.\nWhenever pagination is provided, it **MUST** be valid.\nFailing to provide pagination when it is required or providing wrong or incomplete pagination\nalways results in a `400 Bad Request` error response.\n\nThe page numbering starts with `1` and the maximum page size (if not otherwise documented\non an endpoint) is `100`. Pagination **MUST NOT** be specified if requesting a list of IDs (using an `ids[]` parameter).\n\nProviding invalid values for page number or page size, as well as providing only a page number or only a page size,\nis considered an error. Pagination is provided like this:\n\n`page[number]=1&page[size]=25`\n\nResponses conform to the [JSON:API specification's pagination section](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination)\nby including pagination links. Your requested page size will be carried into the pagination links.\n\n## Sorting\n\nRequests to collection endpoints usually accept a `sort` parameter. Please refer to the\n[JSON:API Specification's sorting section](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sorting) for further details.\n\n## Relationship Linking\n\nCurrently, resources return all of their relationships, in no particular order, pursuant to how relationships\nshould be returned [according to the JSON:API specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-relationships). Consumers of this API\n**MUST NOT** make assumptions about the order of these collections.

All media asset styles except `stripped-original` consist of the cropped image.\n\nAn image has media assets with the following styles:\n\n- `original`: This is the original file provided. May not be available, depending on permissions\n  and file type.\n- `stripped-original`: The original file with all metadata (EXIF, XMP, PNG metadata, etc.) removed.\n  This should be used for any application needing the original, uncropped, image.\n- `regular`: If the image has cropping defined, this is the cropped image.\n  If not, this is a square version of the original.\n- `thumb`: A square thumbnail of the image with a size of `100x100` pixels.\n- `square-400`: A square version of the image with a size of `400x400` pixels.\n- `square-640`: A square version of the image with a size of `640x640` pixels.\n- `square-888`: A square version of the image with a size of `888x888` pixels.\n- `square-3000`: A square version of the image with a size of `3000x3000` pixels.\n  This variant is only created if the cropped width & height are each at least 3000.\n- `itunes`: A square version of the image with a size of `1400x1400` pixels.\n\n### Preferred image used in feeds\n\nFor the main series image used in feeds, it is ideal to use the `square-3000` version.\nIf that is not available, the `itunes` version should be used instead.\n\n","parameters":[{"collectionFormat":"multi","description":"The list of IDs to filter by.

May not be available, depending on permissions\n  and file type.\n- `stripped-original`: The original file with all metadata (EXIF, XMP, PNG metadata, etc.) removed.\n  This should be used for any application needing the original, uncropped, image.\n- `regular`: If the image has cropping defined, this is the cropped image.\n  If not, this is a square version of the original.\n- `thumb`: A square thumbnail of the image with a size of `100x100` pixels.\n- `square-400`: A square version of the image with a size of `400x400` pixels.\n- `square-640`: A square version of the image with a size of `640x640` pixels.\n- `square-888`: A square version of the image with a size of `888x888` pixels.\n- `square-3000`: A square version of the image with a size of `3000x3000` pixels.\n  This variant is only created if the cropped width & height are each at least 3000.\n- `itunes`: A square version of the image with a size of `1400x1400` pixels.\n\n### Preferred image used in feeds\n\nFor the main series image used in feeds, it is ideal to use the `square-3000` version.\nIf that is not available, the `itunes` version should be used instead.\n\n","parameters":[{"description":"The ID of the image resource to load.","example":"6bb474f9-3267-4182-bcfd-a67870f59601","format":"uuid","in":"path","name":"id","required":true,"type":"string"}],"produces":["application/vnd.api+json"],"responses":{"200":{"description":"Success","schema":{"properties":{"data":{"$ref":"#/definitions/Image"},"links":{"$ref":"#/definitions/ResourceLink"}},"type":"object"}},"401":{"$ref":"#/responses/unauthorized"},"403":{"$ref":"#/responses/forbidden"},"404":{"$ref":"#/responses/not_found"},"406":{"$ref":"#/responses/not_acceptable"},"429":{"$ref":"#/responses/rate_limit_exceeded"}},"security":[{"api_key":[]}],"summary":"Get a specific image","tags":["Image"],"x-codeSamples":[{"label":"Ruby - Typhoeus","lang":"ruby","source":"response = Typhoeus.get(\n  \"https://art19.com/images/ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5\",\n  accept_encoding: 'gzip',\n  headers: {\n    Accept:        'application/vnd.api+json',\n    Authorization: 'Token token=\"UVd4c0lFTnZjSKbElFSm\", credential=\"ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5\"'\n  },\n  timeout: 10\n)\nif response.success?\n  # HTTP 2xx - JSON:API available to be parsed in response.body\nelsif response.timed_out?\n  # Request timed out\nelsif response.code.zero?\n  # cURL didn't get back an HTTP response, the reason is in response.return_message\nelse\n  # Other HTTP status, check response.code for which\nend\n"},{"label":"JavaScript - Fetch","lang":"javascript","source":"try {\n  const response = await fetch('https://art19.com/images/ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5', {\n    headers: {\n      Accept:        'application/vnd.api+json',\n      Authorization: 'Token token=\"UVd4c0lFTnZjSKbElFSm\", credential=\"ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5\"'\n    }\n  });\n\n  if (response.ok) {\n    // Get the response body if HTTP-status is 200-299\n    const json = await response.json();\n  } else {\n    // HTTP request failed, handle error\n  }\n} catch(err) {\n  // A network error occured\n}\n"},{"label":"PHP - cURL","lang":"php","source":"<?php\n// Initialize a cURL resource for a request\n$request = curl_init();\n\ntry {\n  // Configure the cURL options\n  curl_setopt($request, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://art19.com/images/ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5');\n  curl_setopt($request, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true);\n  curl_setopt($request, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);\n  curl_setopt($request, CURLOPT_ENCODING, '');\n  curl_setopt($request, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(\n    'Accept: application/vnd.api+json',\n    'Authorization: Token token=\"UVd4c0lFTnZjSKbElFSm\", credential=\"ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5\"'\n  ));\n\n  // Execute the request and grab all status information\n  $output = curl_exec($request);\n  $info   = curl_getinfo($request);\n  $code   = $info['http_code'];\n\n  if ($code >= 200 && $code < 300) {\n    // HTTP 2xx - JSON:API response available to be parsed in $output\n    $json = json_decode($output);\n  } else if ($code >= 400 && $code < 500) {\n    // HTTP 4xx - Client error; JSON:API response evt. available to be parsed in $output\n    if (strlen($output) > 0) {\n      $errors = json_decode($output);\n    }\n  } else {\n    // Other HTTP status, treat according to workflow\n  }\n} finally {\n  // Free up the resource to clear out memory\n  curl_close($request);\n}\n?>\n"},{"label":"cURL","lang":"shell","source":"curl 'https://art19.com/images/ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/vnd.api+json' \\\n  -H 'authorization: Token token=\"UVd4c0lFTnZjSKbElFSm\", credential=\"ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5\"' \\\n  --compressed\n"}]}},"/marker_point_content_rules":{"get":{"description":"Content rules, also known as AIP Priorities, control which types of ads can be inserted into specific marker points.

This area – identified by a coordinate\n`x, y` and a `width` & `height` – is the portion of the image used for all cover art. If an image has\ncropping defined, the cropped version of the image will be used in any `regular` or `square` style of media\nasset. If the original file is rectangular and does not have cropping, then the system will use a squared\nversion of the original file with the smaller of width or height as the square size.\n\nThe original image as uploaded into the system is always retained unmodified and available through\nthe style `original`. All media asset styles except `stripped-original` consist of the cropped image.\n\nAn image has media assets with the following styles:\n\n- `original`: This is the original file provided. May not be available, depending on permissions\n  and file type.\n- `stripped-original`: The original file with all metadata (EXIF, XMP, PNG metadata, etc.) removed.\n  This should be used for any application needing the original, uncropped, image.\n- `regular`: If the image has cropping defined, this is the cropped image.\n  If not, this is a square version of the original.\n- `thumb`: A square thumbnail of the image with a size of `100x100` pixels.\n- `square-400`: A square version of the image with a size of `400x400` pixels.\n- `square-640`: A square version of the image with a size of `640x640` pixels.\n- `square-888`: A square version of the image with a size of `888x888` pixels.\n- `square-3000`: A square version of the image with a size of `3000x3000` pixels.\n  This variant is only created if the cropped width & height are each at least 3000.\n- `itunes`: A square version of the image with a size of `1400x1400` pixels.\n\n### Preferred image used in feeds\n\nFor the main series image used in feeds, it is ideal to use the `square-3000` version.\nIf that is not available, the `itunes` version should be used instead.\n\n\n## Styles for Audio\n\n- `medium`: A medium-quality version of the audio asset in various formats.\n- `original`: This is the original file provided. May not be available, depending on permissions\n  and file type.\n- `waveform_data`: The generated BBC Audiowaveform data in JSON or binary format.\n\n","parameters":[{"description":"The ID of the media asset resource to load.","example":"6bb474f9-3267-4182-bcfd-a67870f59601","format":"uuid","in":"path","name":"id","required":true,"type":"string"}],"produces":["application/vnd.api+json"],"responses":{"200":{"description":"Success","schema":{"properties":{"data":{"$ref":"#/definitions/MediaAsset"},"links":{"$ref":"#/definitions/ResourceLink"}},"type":"object"}},"401":{"$ref":"#/responses/unauthorized"},"403":{"$ref":"#/responses/forbidden"},"404":{"$ref":"#/responses/not_found"},"406":{"$ref":"#/responses/not_acceptable"},"429":{"$ref":"#/responses/rate_limit_exceeded"}},"security":[{"api_key":[]}],"summary":"Get a specific media asset","tags":["MediaAsset"],"x-codeSamples":[{"label":"Ruby - Typhoeus","lang":"ruby","source":"response = Typhoeus.get(\n  \"https://art19.com/media_assets/ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5\",\n  accept_encoding: 'gzip',\n  headers: {\n    Accept:        'application/vnd.api+json',\n    Authorization: 'Token token=\"UVd4c0lFTnZjSKbElFSm\", credential=\"ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5\"'\n  },\n  timeout: 10\n)\nif response.success?\n  # HTTP 2xx - JSON:API available to be parsed in response.body\nelsif response.timed_out?\n  # Request timed out\nelsif response.code.zero?\n  # cURL didn't get back an HTTP response, the reason is in response.return_message\nelse\n  # Other HTTP status, check response.code for which\nend\n"},{"label":"JavaScript - Fetch","lang":"javascript","source":"try {\n  const response = await fetch('https://art19.com/media_assets/ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5', {\n    headers: {\n      Accept:        'application/vnd.api+json',\n      Authorization: 'Token token=\"UVd4c0lFTnZjSKbElFSm\", credential=\"ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5\"'\n    }\n  });\n\n  if (response.ok) {\n    // Get the response body if HTTP-status is 200-299\n    const json = await response.json();\n  } else {\n    // HTTP request failed, handle error\n  }\n} catch(err) {\n  // A network error occured\n}\n"},{"label":"PHP - cURL","lang":"php","source":"<?php\n// Initialize a cURL resource for a request\n$request = curl_init();\n\ntry {\n  // Configure the cURL options\n  curl_setopt($request, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://art19.com/media_assets/ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5');\n  curl_setopt($request, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, true);\n  curl_setopt($request, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);\n  curl_setopt($request, CURLOPT_ENCODING, '');\n  curl_setopt($request, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(\n    'Accept: application/vnd.api+json',\n    'Authorization: Token token=\"UVd4c0lFTnZjSKbElFSm\", credential=\"ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5\"'\n  ));\n\n  // Execute the request and grab all status information\n  $output = curl_exec($request);\n  $info   = curl_getinfo($request);\n  $code   = $info['http_code'];\n\n  if ($code >= 200 && $code < 300) {\n    // HTTP 2xx - JSON:API response available to be parsed in $output\n    $json = json_decode($output);\n  } else if ($code >= 400 && $code < 500) {\n    // HTTP 4xx - Client error; JSON:API response evt. available to be parsed in $output\n    if (strlen($output) > 0) {\n      $errors = json_decode($output);\n    }\n  } else {\n    // Other HTTP status, treat according to workflow\n  }\n} finally {\n  // Free up the resource to clear out memory\n  curl_close($request);\n}\n?>\n"},{"label":"cURL","lang":"shell","source":"curl 'https://art19.com/media_assets/ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5' \\\n  -H 'accept: application/vnd.api+json' \\\n  -H 'authorization: Token token=\"UVd4c0lFTnZjSKbElFSm\", credential=\"ab17a8eb-3d5b-455d-84ac-15a98fde7bb5\"' \\\n  --compressed\n"}]}},"/networks":{"get":{"parameters":[{"collectionFormat":"multi","description":"The list of IDs to filter by.
